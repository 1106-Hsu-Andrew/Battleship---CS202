TO DO LIST

1. everything (classes)
    - i think all of the classes are made incorrectly,
    so we need to fix that. we need to especially check
    the inherited classes and any classes that use arrays

    - i especially don't like game, board, and coordinate.
    i don't know if we need to have the coordinate class,
    but we can keep it if need be

2. come up with helper functions
3. code main.cpp
